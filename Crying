Things I have cried over:
1. Snakes- they don't have arms and they're predatory noodles
2. Sad dogs
3. Just sad animals in general
4. The cruelness of humanity
5. Steven Universe
6. Movies- I cry at most movies. I think it's just being in a dark room with no one judging
7. When a super happy and positive character finally breaks down.
8. Death
9. Drawing a really weird drawing at 3 a.m.
10.Mission Farewells
11. Other people crying.
12. People being happy with their dogs in movies
