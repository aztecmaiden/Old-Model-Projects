I know a lot of things about fairies and cryptids.
Like a lot. I have entire shelf of books at home.
        Here's a list of some of the ones I know:
            Seelie (ocassionly called light faeries)
            Unseelie (Dark faeries, basically the opposite of Seelie)
            Selkies (seal women)
            Harpies (half bird women who lure sailors to their death)
            Mothman (he had glowing red eyes and supposedly predicted a bridge collapsing)
            Jersey Devil (was the 13th baby and was cursed to look like a horse demon)
            Kitsune (Japanese fox demons that like to play pranks on humans)
            Brownies (house elves that clean your home)
            Centaur (half men half horse, of course)
            Satyr (like a centaur but replace horse with goat)
            Wendigo (a creature created by cannibalistic tendencies in humans)
            Ariel (air sprites, no physical form.)
            Sirens (like Harpies except prettier. Live near the sea and still want to kill you)
            Mermaids ( half fish, half person, most want to kill you)
